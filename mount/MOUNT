## Encrypted VM-specific Containers:

# Usage:
encrypt-vm-container.sh testvm 15GB
decrypt-vm-container.sh testvm

lock-vm-container.sh testvm
lock-all-containers.sh

unlock-vm-container.sh testvm
unlock-all-containers.sh

restore-vm-nocontainer.sh testvm

## explanation:
# creating a new encrypted container:
# moves appvms/container to appvms/enc-container
# creates an encrypted luks image of the container in appvms/container.img
# mounts the new luks image in appvms/container
# copies all the files from appvms/enc-container to appvms/container

# the user should remove appvms/enc-container manually afterwards once everything works fine
# alternatively run: restore-vm-nocontainer.sh container

# before being able to mount a vm, unlock-vm-container.sh or unlock-all-containers.sh must have been executed!
# important: make a shutdown shortcut that runs lock-all-containers.sh before system shutdown!
